# Emotion-Analysis-Project

## TO-DO:
- cleaning and preprocessing the tweets (in progress)
- joining tweets with emotional dictionary 
- some visualisations: word clouds for each user, word frequencies, scatterplots to check for correlations (e. g. dominance-party, emotionality-size/outreach of profile), barplots
- statistical models: t-test, linear regression (predicting rt count)
